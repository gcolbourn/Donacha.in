Donations through DAO's
GENERAL 
An open source smart contract for Dao’s donations. 

Contract could be integrated with DAO’s so it could share revenues with charities selected by the members. 

Conversion to fiat and donation to any approved charities around the world 

DAO’s token holders would vote if, how much, how often and who to donate to. 


Slock.it Dao PROPOSAL:

Adding a multisig address to whitelist - smart contract to accept portion of the reward tokens 

Whitelisted address is a smart contract. It reciecves funds from reward tokens, converts to fiat (exchanges api) and distributed to mentioned charities (via justgiving api or any other online to offline donations).

The rewardtokens for chairty are distibuted annually. Dao members would be able to submit a proposal to the Smart contract,
to vote\choose 3 charities to donate to.  

Address is multisig and private keys held by DAO curators and an outside agreed organizations (possibly Donachain Curators)

Track donation from blockchain explorer and charity receipt. 

TBD

Whitelist address has extrabalance account for sporadic donations.

Further Ideas:

Disaster relief through Facebook api for disaster reports

Excluding religious and political charities

Direct support (not via charities), for example refugee camps

Slackbot for donations, to allow individual members to donate easily and seamlessly
